## Types of Websites 🌐

There are 3 main types of websites to find movies and TV Shows. 

1> Streaming Websites. \
2> Direct Download websites.\
3> Torrent download websites.

#### I recommend using **torrents** and **Streaming**.

There are many torrent clients to choose from but you should probably just stick to [**QBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) or [**Transmission**](https://transmissionbt.com/).

#### Under no circumstances use `Bittorrent` or `uTorrent`. _**These are ad filled spyware**_.
