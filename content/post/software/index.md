This page has many websites related to software. Mostly focusing on Windows software. I have included a few for MacOS too.

#### **Always use Ad blockers when visiting any website.**

#### **I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ANY COMPLAINS ABOUT GETTING A VIRUS BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB AND DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO CLICK.**

Use [UBlockOrigin](https://ublockorigin.com/) or [AdGuard](https://adguard.com). Do not use AdBlock or AdBlockPlus.

#### I recommend using **DDL** for software since the size is smaller.

Always remember this for torrents : 

There are many torrent clients to choose from but you should probably just stick to [**QBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) or [**Transmission**](https://transmissionbt.com/).

#### Under no circumstances use `Bittorrent` or `uTorrent`. _**These are ad filled spyware**_.

## Torrent Websites 🧲


#### 🔥 [M0nkrus](https://w14.monkrus.ws/)

I love this website. It's in russian and requires a good amount of knowledge but you can find almost any major software that are usually pre-cracked.

#### 🔥 [Mac Torrents](https://www.torrentmac.net/)

tl;dr: ***❌Slightly bigger than Fitgirl, ✅Faster Install than Fitgirl***

Dodi is just like fitgirl except they release a lot more games than FitGirl. Dodi also releases games cracked by Empress (FitGirl doesn't). Dodi's releases are similar or just slightly bigger in size compared to FitGirl but the install times a significantly reduced. I would recommend Dodi if you have slow but unlimited internet. Go with fitgirl if you have limited bandwidth.

## DDL Websites ⏬

Now, DDL Websites are good if you have good stable internet. They do not require any kind of special software although you can use [JDownloader2](https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2). JDownloaded provides many good features such as the ability to resume downloads and safer parallel downloads.

### Old Games 💻

You can download many old games which are not available to buy anywhere making them abandonware. 

#### 🔥 [MyAbandonWare](https://www.myabandonware.com/)

Great website. The downloads are safe and the files are clean. A lot of classic games are available on this.

#### 🔥 [OldGamesDownload](https://oldgamesdownload.com/)

Great simple website. Files are usually hosted on Archive.org or MEGA.

#### 🔥 [Alternative : Archive.org Repository](https://archive.org/details/classicpcgames)

This is something you should visit last only because how throttled the Archive.org servers usually are.

### Modern Games 🎮

These websites are the ones I've tested myself. You can use any of these to download almost any game.

#### 🔥 [GameDrive.Org](https://gamedrive.org/)

My absolute favorite website for DDLs. The downloads are very fast and it's very easy to import it into JDownloader2.

#### 🔥 [G4U](https://g4u.to)

I avoid this website because they use premium hosters. Great if you have access to any Debrid service.

#### 🔥 [GOG-Games](https://www.gog-games.to/)

GOG-Games releases games from the orginial GOG website. The files are untouched because games released on GOG do not require cracks to work.

#### 🔥 [OVAGames](https://www.ovagames.com)

OVAGames is absolutely GOATED. The files are hosted on Google Drive and MediaFire among others.

#### 🔥 [ElAmigos](https://elamigos.site/)

ElAmigos repacks are great if you have fast internet and a lot space. Although I would recommend getting the releases from GameDrive.Org because of hoster issues.
