This page has many websites related to software. Mostly focusing on Windows software. I have included a few for MacOS too.

`Pirated softwares use cracks. Cracks are usually detected by your Anti-Virus. The website listed here are safe and tested. I still advice you to take precaution and avoid clicking on ads and fake download buttons on this website. You should also try to manually add each crack file exclusion in Windows Defender or your Anti-Virus. Avoid excluding complete folders and drives.`

#### **Always use Ad blockers when visiting any website.**

#### **I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ANY COMPLAINS ABOUT GETTING A VIRUS BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB AND DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO CLICK.**

Use [UBlockOrigin](https://ublockorigin.com/) or [AdGuard](https://adguard.com). Do not use AdBlock or AdBlockPlus.

#### I recommend using **DDL** for software since the size is smaller.

Always remember this for torrents : 

There are many torrent clients to choose from but you should probably just stick to [**QBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) or [**Transmission**](https://transmissionbt.com/).

#### Under no circumstances use `Bittorrent` or `uTorrent`. _**These are ad filled spyware**_.
