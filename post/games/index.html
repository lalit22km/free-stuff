<h4 id="always-use-ad-blockers-when-visiting-any-website"><strong>Always use Ad blockers when visiting any website.</strong></h4>

<h4 id="i-absolutely-do-not-want-to-hear-any-complains-about-getting-a-virus-because-you-are-dumb-and-do-not-know-where-to-click"><strong>I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ANY COMPLAINS ABOUT GETTING A VIRUS BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB AND DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO CLICK.</strong></h4>

<h2 id="types-of-releases-">Types of Releases 🕹️</h2>
<p>You can download games mainly using 2 methods. <strong>Direct Downloads</strong> (often called DDL) or <strong>Torrents</strong>. Both have their pros and cons and many differences but I usually go with torrents myself because of the following reasons.</p>
<p>1&gt; Torrents are resumable and have no transfer limit.<br>
2&gt; Torrents use P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Sharing.<br>
3&gt; Direct Downloads are prone to random failures especially with large files or shoddy internet.</p>
<h4 id="i-recommend-using-torrents">I recommend using <strong>torrents</strong>.</h4>
<p>There are many torrent clients to choose from but you should probably just stick to <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/"><strong>QBittorrent</strong></a> or <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/"><strong>Transmission</strong></a>.</p>
<h4 id="under-no-circumstances-use-bittorrent-or-utorrent-_these-are-ad-filled-spyware_">Under no circumstances use <code>Bittorrent</code> or <code>uTorrent</code>. <em><strong>These are ad filled spyware</strong></em>.</h4>
<hr>
<h2 id="torrent-websites-">Torrent Websites 🧲</h2>
<p>These are the torrent websites you should be able to find almost any game on.</p>
<h4 id="-fitgirl-repackshttpsfitgirl-repackssite">🔥 <a href="https://fitgirl-repacks.site">Fitgirl Repacks</a></h4>
<p>tl;dr: <em><strong>✅Small Size, ❌Slow Install</strong></em></p>
<p>Fitgirl is one of the best source of games. The good thing about FitGirl is the small download sizes. Some games are compressed 2-5x their original size.</p>
<p>I do not use fitgirl anymore because I have fast reliable internet now and the installation time is <em><strong>VERY LONG</strong></em>.</p>
<h4 id="-dodi-repackshttpsdodi-repackssite">🔥 <a href="https://dodi-repacks.site">Dodi Repacks</a></h4>
<p>tl;dr: <em><strong>❌Slightly bigger than Fitgirl, ✅Faster Install than Fitgirl</strong></em></p>
<p>Dodi is just like fitgirl except they release a lot more games than FitGirl. Dodi also releases games cracked by Empress (FitGirl doesn&rsquo;t). Dodi&rsquo;s releases are similar or just slightly bigger in size compared to FitGirl but the install times a significantly reduced. I would recommend Dodi if you have slow but unlimited internet. Go with fitgirl if you have limited bandwidth.</p>
<h4 id="-xatabhttpsbyxatabcom-">🔥 <a href="https://byxatab.com/">XATab</a> 🇷🇺</h4>
<p>tl;dr: <em><strong>❌Large repacks, ✅Very fast install speeds</strong></em></p>
<p>XATab is a russian release group. Their releases are larger in size but are very fast to install. Make sure to change the language when visiting their website.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ddl-websites-">DDL Websites ⏬</h2>
<p>Now, DDL Websites are good if you have good stable internet. They do not require any kind of special software although you can use <a href="https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2">JDownloader2</a>. JDownloaded provides many good features such as the ability to resume downloads and safer parallel downloads.</p>
<h3 id="old-games-">Old Games 💻</h3>
<p>You can download many old games which are not available to buy anywhere making them abandonware.</p>
<h4 id="-myabandonwarehttpswwwmyabandonwarecom">🔥 <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/">MyAbandonWare</a></h4>
<p>Great website. The downloads are safe and the files are clean. A lot of classic games are available on this.</p>
<h4 id="-oldgamesdownloadhttpsoldgamesdownloadcom">🔥 <a href="https://oldgamesdownload.com/">OldGamesDownload</a></h4>
<p>Great simple website. Files are usually hosted on Archive.org or MEGA.</p>
<h4 id="-alternative--archiveorg-repositoryhttpsarchiveorgdetailsclassicpcgames">🔥 <a href="https://archive.org/details/classicpcgames">Alternative : Archive.org Repository</a></h4>
<p>This is something you should visit last only because how throttled the Archive.org servers usually are.</p>
<h3 id="modern-games-">Modern Games 🎮</h3>
<p>These websites are the ones I&rsquo;ve tested myself. You can use any of these to download almost any game.</p>
<h4 id="-gamedriveorghttpsgamedriveorg">🔥 <a href="https://gamedrive.org/">GameDrive.Org</a></h4>
<p>My absolute favorite website for DDLs. The downloads are very fast and it&rsquo;s very easy to import it into JDownloader2.</p>
<h4 id="-g4uhttpsg4uto">🔥 <a href="https://g4u.to">G4U</a></h4>
<p>I avoid this website because they use premium hosters. Great if you have access to any Debrid service.</p>
<h4 id="-gog-gameshttpswwwgog-gamesto-private-invite-only">🔥 <a href="https://www.gog-games.to/">GOG-Games</a> Private (Invite Only)</h4>
<p>GOG-Games went private. It&rsquo;s invite only now. Sad.</p>
<p>GOG-Games releases games from the orginial GOG website. The files are untouched because games released on GOG do not require cracks to work.</p>
<h4 id="-ovagameshttpswwwovagamescom">🔥 <a href="https://www.ovagames.com">OVAGames</a></h4>
<p>OVAGames is absolutely GOATED. The files are hosted on Google Drive and MediaFire among others.</p>
<h4 id="-elamigoshttpselamigossite">🔥 <a href="https://elamigos.site/">ElAmigos</a></h4>
<p>ElAmigos repacks are great if you have fast internet and a lot space. Although I would recommend getting the releases from GameDrive.Org because of hoster issues.</p></div>
